# ScratchX-Extensions
I'm trying to make a Scratch Extension.

Go to http://scratchx.org/?url=http://lifaythegoblin.github.io/ScratchX-Extensions/CatX-sample.sbx to see what it does!

Thanks to Thepuzzlegame on Scratch for helping me when something didn't work!
Thanks to savaka2 for fixing a block and helping me with getting the right URL for the sample project!
